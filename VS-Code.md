# Features of Visual Studio Code


* **Intellisense**  is code auto-complete meets artificial intelligence. This utility provides a list of suggestions along with a short hint or description as we are writing codes. These is derived from several contextual factors such as the programming language, the syntax, the variables, the functions as well as all the codes within the file.IntelliSense supports a number of programming language out-of-the-box, including Sass, LESS, JavaScript, TypeScript, and PHP. Some extensions to include IntelliSense for other programming languages are also available. It is a great feature to improve productivity.


* **Peek** while coding, you may often forget a particular function, where the function is initially defined, and what are the required parameters.With Peek, you can select a function then hit Shift + F12. The selection expands into an inline window showing the complete definition of the function as well as where the function is defined. The feature currently works in C, C#, JavaScript, TypeScript, .NET, and a few other programming languages.


* **CLI** similar to SublimeText with its subl command line, Visual Studio Code is equipped a CLI named code and it is easy to install.In Windows, the CLI will have already been installed along with the app. The CLI is accessible through the Command Prompt. In OS X, it can be installed and uninstalled through the Command Palette.You can use the CLI to open a particular directory to Visual Studio Code, or open your current project directory in Terminal or Command Prompt directly from the editor.


* **Built-in Git** visual studio code has Git built right in the editor. On the left of the sidebar, you will find the Git icon where you can initialize Git as well as perform several Git commands such as commit, pull, push, rebase, publish, and look into the changes within the file.


* **Task Runner** last but not least, Visual Studio Code also has a built-in Task Runner, which provides some level of convenience .To use this feature, we can either set a tasks.json file or through some popular Task configuration like Grunt, Gulp, or MSBuild if provided. Once the configuration is set, we can run the Task Runner through the Command Palette by typing Run Task. Typing Tasks will list all related commands.


# Plugins


* **Quokka** is a debugging tool that gives live feedback on the code you are writing. It shows you previews of the results of functions and calculated values for variables. The extension is easy to configure and works out of the box with JSX or TypeScript projects.


* **Faker** quickly insert placeholder data using the popular Faker JavaScript library. You can generate random names, addresses, images, phone numbers, or just paragraphs of classic Lorem Ipsum. Each category has various subcategories so you can make the data fit your needs.


* **CSS Peek**  with this extension you can trace the definitions of CSS classes and ids in your stylesheets. When you right click on a selector in your HTML files, choosing the options Go to Definition and Peek definition will send you to the CSS code in which you've styled them.


* **HTML Boilerplate** extension will save you from having to manually write the head and body tags of a new HTML document. Just type html in an empty file, hit the Tab key, and a clean document structure will be generated.


* **Prettier** is the most popular code formatter in web dev right now. It allows your team's code look the same, no matter who wrote it. This extension makes it possible to automatically apply Prettier and quickly format whole JS and CSS documents. If you also want to throw ESLint in the mix, there is Prettier - Eslint.


* **Color Info** small plugin that gives you various information about the colors you've used in your CSS. By hovering on a color you can see a larger preview of how it looks, as well as info about its translation to all formats (hex, rgb, hsl, and cmyk).


 * **Minify** extension for minifying your code. It offers a ton of customization settings and the option to automatically minify on save and export to a .min file. Minify works with JavaScript, CSS, and HTML through uglify-js, clean-css, and html-minifier respectively.


* **Change Case** vs code has limited options for transforming text. Out of the box it can only do lowercase and uppercase transforms. This plugin adds a lot more commands for modifying strings, including camelCase, kebab-case, snake_case, CONST_CASE, and others.


* **Regex Previewer** useful tool for live testing your regular expressions. It works by applying the regex pattern over any text file opened to the side, highlighting all the matches. Kinda like RegExr but right inside your editor.
